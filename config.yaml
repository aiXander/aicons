# AICONS Configuration
# Run `python -m src.device_manager` to find your device IDs

# Audio Device IDs
# These must be set after running device_manager.py to identify your devices
# Device IDs are platform-specific - run device_manager on each system
devices:
  # Microphone input device ID
  # Examples: MacBook Pro Microphone (macOS), Microphone Array (Windows)
  mic_id: 1

  # Virtual cable output device ID
  # Examples: BlackHole 2ch (macOS), CABLE Input (Windows), VirtualCable (Linux)
  cable_id: 0

  # Speaker output for monitoring (optional, for hearing agent responses)
  # Examples: MacBook Pro Speakers (macOS), Speakers (Windows)
  speaker_id: 2

# Audio Settings
audio:
  # Sample rate in Hz (ElevenLabs standard is 16000)
  sample_rate: 16000

  # Number of input channels (1 = mono, required for ElevenLabs)
  channels: 1

  # Number of output channels for virtual cable
  # Set to match your virtual cable:
  #   - BlackHole 2ch: 2
  #   - VB-Cable: 2
  #   - Custom setups: check with device_manager.py
  output_channels: 2

  # Audio data type (int16 for ElevenLabs compatibility)
  dtype: int16

  # Buffer size for audio streams (frames per buffer)
  # Lower = less latency but more CPU, Higher = more latency but stable
  buffer_size: 1024

# UI Settings
ui:
  window_title: "ElevenLabs Agent Controller"
  window_width: 400
  window_height: 300

# Monitor Settings
# Controls whether agent audio is passed through to speakers for verification
monitor:
  # Enable/disable the monitor loop (virtual cable → speakers)
  # Set to false when using the virtual cable as input for external apps (e.g., Unreal Engine)
  enabled: false

# Debug Settings
debug:
  # Print audio stream status messages
  verbose_audio: true
  # Print conversation transcripts to console
  print_transcripts: true
