# Loopback MVP Configuration
# Run `python -m src.device_manager` to find your device IDs

# Audio Device IDs
# These must be set after running device_manager.py to identify your devices
devices:
  # Microphone input (e.g., MacBook Pro Microphone)

# Audio Settings
audio:
  # Sample rate in Hz (ElevenLabs standard is 16000)
  sample_rate: 16000
  # Number of audio channels for input (1 = mono for ElevenLabs)
  channels: 1
  # Number of channels for output devices (2 for BlackHole 2ch and speakers)
  output_channels: 2
  # Audio data type
